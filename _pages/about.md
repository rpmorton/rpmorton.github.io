I am a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University at the Economic Growth Center (Markets and Development Initiative). My research interests are in development economics, industrial organization, and health economics.

Starting July 2025, I will be an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Rochester (Simon Business School).
