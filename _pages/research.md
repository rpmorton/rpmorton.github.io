### [Value Creation and Value Capture in Indian Garment Sector Bargaining](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SpxGm7bKFBeSrq-szBUWVIQKxTBr8SeM/view?usp=drive_link)

This paper examines creation and distribution of surplus from global value chains (GVCs) in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) domestic supply chains. While GVC participation can enhance growth and productivity, low prices paid to small input suppliers raise concerns about the concentration of gains among large exporters. Many supply chain transactions are governed by bargained agreements rather than spot markets. Therefore, I develop a Nash bargaining model to formalize how both i) value creation through insurance-like agreement terms that mitigate spot market frictions and ii) value capture via buyers threatening to replace external suppliers with in-house production decrease prices paid to small, risk-averse suppliers. Using novel transaction data from an Indian garment manufacturer and its nearly 500 fabric suppliers, I estimate a structural model to decompose observed price discounts into value creation and capture. Results indicate that discounts reflect value creation from profit-smoothing agreement terms rather than buyer capture. Counterfactual analyses highlight that increasing buyer competition has limited effects on supplier prices, whereas introducing profit insurance substantially increases prices for small, risk-averse suppliers.
