### [Value Creation and Value Capture in Indian Garment Sector Bargaining](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SpxGm7bKFBeSrq-szBUWVIQKxTBr8SeM/view?usp=drive_link)
While exporting can enhance growth, low prices paid by large exporters to their small suppliers raise concerns that gains accrue primarily to exporters. However, when input or complementary markets (_e.g._, insurance, credit) function poorly, multifaceted vertical contracts govern prices. Therefore, prices reflect more than standard oligopsony markdowns. This paper uses proprietary data on the universe of fabric purchases by a major Indian garment manufacturer to quantify how prices are shaped by two contract features that emerge in settings when markets function poorly. First, contracts create surplus by mitigating frictions---such as specifying stable quantities to reduce profit variability when insurance markets function poorly---so low prices may reflect the buyer's share of surplus created. Second, buyers reduce sourcing from external suppliers in frictional markets by partially vertically integrating, potentially enabling surplus capture through threats to replace external suppliers with in-house production. I estimate a structural bargaining model to decompose how prices reflect these two features. Surplus creation from insurance-like contract terms explains low prices, with the buyer receiving ~60% of gains, rather than capture from replacement threats; difference-in-differences estimates yield consistent findings. Counterfactuals illustrate that greater buyer competition has limited effects on prices paid to small risk-averse suppliers, but profit insurance substantially increases prices.
