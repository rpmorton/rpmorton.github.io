### [Value Creation and Value Capture in Indian Garment Sector Bargaining](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SpxGm7bKFBeSrq-szBUWVIQKxTBr8SeM/view?usp=drive_link)
		
Low prices paid by large exporters to their small suppliers raise distributional concerns about gains from exporting. However, when input or complementary markets (_e.g._, insurance, credit) function poorly, multifaceted vertical contracts govern prices that incorporate more than standard oligopsony markdowns. This paper uses proprietary data on the universe of fabric purchases by a large Indian garment exporter to quantify how prices reflect two contract features that emerge when markets function poorly. First, contracts create surplus by mitigating frictions (_e.g._, providing insurance inside the vertical agreement when insurance markets function poorly); then, low prices reflect the buyer's share of surplus created. Second, buyers reduce sourcing from external suppliers through partially vertical integration, enabling surplus capture from threats to replace external suppliers with in-house production. While buyer power both over surplus creation and from surplus capture can lower prices, their distributional implications differ---only creation aligns incentives for agreements to mitigate frictions. Estimates from a structural bargaining model show that buyer power over surplus creation, not from surplus capture, explains low prices; the buyer retains ~60% of gains. Counterfactuals illustrate that greater buyer competition has limited effects on prices paid to small risk-averse suppliers, but profit insurance substantially increases prices.
